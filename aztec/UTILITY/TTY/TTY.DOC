NAME

 tty - terminal emulation program

SYNOPSIS

 tty -syy -bxx

DESCRIPTION

 tty is a terminal emulation program that allows an Apple //
operator to talk to another computer. To the other system, the Apple
// will appear to be a terminal that supports some of the special
features of the ADM-3A terminal.

 tty reads characters from the keyboard and writes them to a serial
interface. It also reads characters from this interface and writes them
to the console. This interface must be compatible with the Super
Serial Card.

 The -s option defines the number of the slot containing the
interface. The number immediately follows the -s, with no
intervening spaces. If this option isn't specified, the interface is
assumed to be in slot 2.

 The -b option defines the baud rate of the serial interface. The
baud rate immediately follows the -b option, with no intervening
spaces. If this option isn't specified, the baud rate is assumed to be
9600.

 To exit tty, type control-2; ie, type the '2' key while holding down
the control key.
