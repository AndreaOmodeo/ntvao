ReadMe for the CG65 Tools Directory

tmake.exe - old version of turbo make which I use instead of the Aztec
C make utility. I just prefer the syntax.

You can build each of the samples from the shortcuts provided by typing
"tmake" in their respective directories at the Windows XP command
prompt created by the shortcut.

The other utilities listed below are called by the MAKEFILE for the
samples.I used the nmake from Microsoft's last 16 bit compiler to build
these programs. Review the source code for more information.

appibtxt.exe - converts apple to IBM text files or vice versa. Revised
somewhat 2008 to display usage and handle unix text and added some
minor fix-ups like autodetecting input files etc.

makeprg.exe - strips the 4 byte bloadable header from a manx C65
executable and outputs a same named file with an extension. Default
extension is PRG.
