ReadMe for AZC6532C

AZTEC C CROSS Compiler
HOST: PC DOS/MS DOS
TARGET:65XX ROM
VERSION: 3.20C
CODE: C26C

Manx Aztec CG65 Cross Development Software for 65xx-based Systems
Aztec CG65 v3.2c 10-2-89. Runs on MS-DOS.

This is the CG65 compiler from Marco Aurelio which is a later version 
than the Paul Santa Maria Version.

Set-up, libraries built, and rebundled for Windows XP, but should work
just fine in any MS-DOS environment or emulator since I have kept this
16 bit for my humble part.

Unzip and you should be good to go. Read the manual available from

http://www.aztecmuseum.ca/

and see the samples in the samples directory for more details.

Have Fun!
